Oni-ESAMEDAV | The Essential and Accessible Tool for Downloading and Converting Media Files

Oni-ESAMEDAV is a screen reader-friendly GUI for YT-DLP, a powerful module for downloading YouTube and other online video files. It also integrates the FFMPEG open-source file conversion tool.

This project is the result of collaborative efforts between my idea and ChatGPT. While the idea and design originate from me, ChatGPT played a crucial role in generating the layout and enhancing the logical components to ensure the project aligns with my idea.

## Features

- User-friendly graphical interface designed for accessibility with screen readers.
- Seamless integration with YT-DLP, offering robust support for downloading content from various websites. Please refer to the YT-DLP repository for a comprehensive list of supported websites.
- Effortlessly download playlists, including entire YouTube playlists, enhancing your content acquisition experience.
- Utilizes FFMPEG for efficient and versatile file conversion.
- Streamlined functionality for converting multiple files simultaneously, saving time and enhancing user convenience.
- Users can extend support for additional file types in the conversion process by adding FFMPEG argument formats in the 'options.json' file.

## Installation

To install Oni-ESAMEDAV, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release.
2. This application is portable. Once downloaded, simply extract the archive and start enjoying its features.

## Known Issues

- Certain YouTube titles may occasionally disrupt the conversion process. If you encounter such issues, you can use the media conversion tab to convert the downloaded file manually for the time being. (I've attempted to address this issue in version 1.0.1, hoping it resolves the problem.)
